# Ignite - Challenge 2: List Filter

### About the ListFilter
In this challenge, you must create a new project with a function that, given a list of strings that represent numbers or not, filter all numeric elements in the list and return how many odd numbers are in that list.

**Example**
```elixir
  iex> ListFilter.call(["1", "3", "6", "43", "banana", "6", "abc"])
  ...> 3
```
